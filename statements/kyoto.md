Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in enrolling in the graduate school of engineering at Kyoto University. As an accomplished dual-degree candidate in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics at UC San Diego, I have developed a strong foundation in both software and hardware development, as well as theoretical computer science.

I am excited about the prospect of exploring a new culture and leaving the United States, where I have spent most of my life. Japan's reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation, as well as its rich cultural heritage, make it an ideal destination for me.

Although I used to focus on the industrial track, my experiences have led me to pursue an academic research track. I believe that the graduate school of engineering at Kyoto University will provide me with the resources and opportunities I need to achieve my goals.

I am academically capable of being a student at Kyoto University, with a strong academic record and a solid foundation in engineering and mathematics. I am particularly interested in enrolling in the Takuya Sakamoto's lab, especially the hardware design and algorithm design. I am confident that these labs align with my research interests, and I am eager to learn from and contribute to these communities.

While I have not yet decided on a specific research plan, my goal is to graduate within two years and focus more on research. I am prepared to take courses if necessary, but I am excited to focus on developing my research skills and contributing to the field.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to pursue my graduate studies at Kyoto University.

Sincerely,  
Yiju Li
