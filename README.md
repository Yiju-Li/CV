As a mathematics enthusiast with a background in engineering, my aspirations are set on becoming a scientist in the future.

## A Mathematics Enthusiast
- Love for Mathematics start from mathematics competition in my early stage, even though failed the Putnam Comptetition in college.
- Love later built by the purility of playing around definitions in this field, even though later found out that's probably the only thing I could do: Learning already-exists Definitions and Theorems rather than creating new ones.
- Love is maintained and ensured by the belief I hold that playing around math could make my brain stay logic and be able to find out inner-connection between things, even though it's just a belief not a scientif fact.

## A Background in engineering
- From Education: I am proud to tell UCSD(w 2nd degree in math)
- From Internships: QA(Company-Year-Time )
