## A Mathematics Enthusiast
-  My love with mathematics started with winning those math competitions[^1] during my early days, though I did stumble in Putnam[^2] 3 times[^3] in a row. 
- The love was further developed through playing 'fancy' definitions, even though I later realized that my strength lies in learning existing definitions and theorems rather than creating new ones.
- Love is maintained and ensured by the belief I hold that playing around math could make my brain stay logic and be able to find out inner-connection between things, even though it's just a belief not a scientif fact.

## A Background in engineering
- From Degree: I take pride in having earned a B.S. degree from Jacobs Engineering School at UCSD. (And it's worth reminding that I hold another B.S. degree from the Math department, just showing my love for mathematics.)
- From Internships: QA(Company-Year-Time )

## A Future Scientist



[^1]: The term "math competitions" mentioned here pertains to those preparing participants for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), from local matches held in a small city named Chengdu to the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME). Winning IMO was my childhood dream, but I ended up losing the opportunity to join the Team China because of study abroad(probably won't be selected anyway) and somehow I can't join Team USA as a Chinese.

[^2]: Putnam is a math competition designed at the university level. A.k.a., the final math competition or most challenging competition. It's worth noting that the median score stands at 0, with an average score of 1 out of a total of 120 possible points.

[^3]: If I still want to participate in it this year, you would see this number turn to 4.
