*I'm a **[mathematics enthusiast](#a-mathematics-enthusiast)** with a **[background in engineering](#a-background-in-engineering)**, and my aspirations are set on becoming a **[scientist in the future](#a-future-scientist)**.*



## A Mathematics Enthusiast
- My love with mathematics started with winning those math competitions[^1] during my early days, though I did stumble in Putnam[^2] 3 years[^3] in a row. 
- After quitting playing League of Legends[^5], Math becomes my favourite game.[^4]


## A Background in engineering
- An Engineering Degree[^6] and couple Engineer Internships[^7].

## A Future Scientist
- My research interests are: (A) designing appropriate learning models and (B) applying them in engineering automation and other domains for good of society and scientific advancements.

[^1]: The term *math competitions* mentioned here pertains to those preparing participants for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), from local matches held in a small city named Chengdu to the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME). Winning IMO was my childhood dream, but I ended up losing the opportunity to join the Team China because of study abroad(probably won't be selected anyway) and somehow I can't join Team USA as a Chinese.

[^2]: *Putnam* is a math competition designed at the university level. A.k.a., the final math competition or most challenging competition. It's worth noting that the median score stands at 0, with an average score of 1 out of a total of 120 possible points.

[^3]: If I still want to participate in it this year, you would see this number *3* turning to *4*. 

[^4]: *Why Math is Fun?* We have created our own definition that one plus one must equals to two, and from there, we have built an entire mathematical world. In mathematics, the only thing that constrains us is our imagination.

[^5]: *League of Legends* is a popular video game. 

[^6]: I am currently pursuing a *B.S. Degree in Computer Engineering* from the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego. 

[^7]: I have interned as a *QA Engineer* for 10 weeks at GloudGame in 2020, as a *Software Engineer* for 8 weeks at UBTech in 2021, and for 10 weeks at S.Mu Life in 2022. Additionally, I interned as an *Electrical Engineer* for 12 weeks at Virgitron in 2023. I have a strong appreciation for the concept of creating a perfectly reliable product in this field, but after realizing the repetitive nature of engineering work, I want to pursue something that is more challenging and exciting.
