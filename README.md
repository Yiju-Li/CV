### A Mathematics Enthusiast
- My love with mathematics started with winning those math competitions[^1] during my early days, though I did stumble in Putnam[^2] 3 years[^3] in a row. 
- After quitting playing League of Legends[^5], Math becomes my favourite game.[^4]


### A Background in engineering
- An Engineering Degree and couple Engineer Internships.

### A Future Scientist


[^1]: The term *math competitions* mentioned here pertains to those preparing participants for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), from local matches held in a small city named Chengdu to the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME). Winning IMO was my childhood dream, but I ended up losing the opportunity to join the Team China because of study abroad(probably won't be selected anyway) and somehow I can't join Team USA as a Chinese.

[^2]: *Putnam* is a math competition designed at the university level. A.k.a., the final math competition or most challenging competition. It's worth noting that the median score stands at 0, with an average score of 1 out of a total of 120 possible points.

[^3]: If I still want to participate in it this year, you would see this number *3* turning to *4*. 

[^4]: *Why Math is Fun?* We have created our own definition that one plus one must equals to two, and from there, we have built an entire mathematical world. In mathematics, the only thing that constrains us is our imagination.

[^5]: *League of Legends* is a popular video game.
